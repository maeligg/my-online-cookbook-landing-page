                        <p>Unlike other general-purpose templates and website builders, My Online Cookbook is optimised out of the box for writing and finding your recipes. Quickly visualise which ingredients you need, easily search for recipes using specific ingredients, and automatically adapt quantities based on the number of servings.</p>

            <h2>How to get started</h2>

            <p>If you are a developer, you may find it easier to read the technical documentation in the <a href="https://github.com/maeligg/my-online-cookbook">project‚Äôs github repository</a>.</p>
            <p>Otherwise, read the instructions or watch the video below then click on <a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/maeligg/my-online-cookbook&stack=cms"><img  class="c-instructions__deploy-button" src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" alt="deploy to netlify"></a> to set up your website.</p>
            
            <details class="c-instructions__details">
                <summary class="c-instructions__summary">Instructions</summary>
                <ol>
                    <li>You'll need a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> account (this is where the code of your site will be kept) and a <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netlify</a> account (to host and deploy your site). Simply go to these sites, click on "sign up" and follow the instructions. These are tools primarily made for developers, but don't worry ! You don't need to know how to code to use them.</li>
                    <li>Click on the "deploy to Netlify" button above, connect to GitHub, choose your repository name (this is only for you and will not be visible to visitors of your site) and click "save & deploy". Once finished, you'll be redirected to the Netlify dashboard, where you should see the live URL of your site at the top (which you can change later), and the status of the deployment.</li>
                    <li>You'll also have received an email at the email address you signed up with Netlify. Click on the link to complete the creation of the admin user of your website (do this before you change the URL of your site, otherwise you'll need to resend a new email invite).</li>
                    <li>Click on the URL of your site in the Netlify dashboard (it should look something like "https://random-words-12345.netlify.app"). To go to the admin interface, simply write "/admin" after the URL (e.g. "https://random-words-12345.netlify.app/admin"). Any changes you make here (after clicking on "publish") will update your website after around 30 seconds.</li>
                    <li>That's it, enjoy your website !</li>
                </ol>
